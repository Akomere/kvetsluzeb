                                            | Květ is the leading market for cleaning services in Germany and Czech Republic. We are not a cleaning agency or cleaning company, we're an intermediary platform that helps match customers like you with self-employed cleaners. Through Květ, you can book a cleaner in 60 seconds. Once you have booked a cleaner you should arrange with them what specific cleaning tasks you would like them to undertake, for example ironing or oven cleaning.

Ideally, jot down a list of cleaning priorities for your cleaner (you can do it per room, or for your entire home). This will help them to focus on the areas that are important to you. When your cleaner arrives, give them a tour and highlight your priorities and any fragile surfaces or items. Don’t forget to show the cleaner where to find your cleaning products and if you have any preferences or surfaces that need special care, make sure to let your cleaner know.

                                            | Four billion years ago, something started stirring in the primordial soup. A few simple chemicals got together and made biology &ndash; the first molecules capable of replicating themselves appeared. We humans are linked by evolution to those early biological molecules. But how did the basic chemicals present on early Earth spontaneously arrange themselves into something resembling life? How did we get DNA? What did the first cells look like? More than half a century after the chemist Stanley Miller proposed his &quot;primordial soup&quot; theory, we still can&apos;t agree about what happened. Some say life began in hot pools near volcanoes, others that it was kick-started by meteorites hitting the sea.
